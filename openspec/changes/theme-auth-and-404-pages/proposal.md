# Proposal: Theme Auth and 404 Pages

## Goal
Update the 404 (Not Found) page and Authentication pages (Login, CLI Auth) to be consistent with the website's light-themed, premium color palette, moving away from "hitam" (black) or default dark styles.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 404 page follows the glassmorphism/themed UI of the app.
- [ ] Login page header and overall vibe matches the new documentation system.
- [ ] CLI Auth page fallback and main state transition away from pure black backgrounds.
- [ ] All pages use the `--color-brand-blue` and other global CSS variables.

## Impact
- Improved UX consistency.
- More professional "first impression" for new users (at login) and lost users (at 404).
