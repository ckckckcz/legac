# Proposal: Change Language to Indonesian

## Why

Legac aims to provide a more localized and user-friendly experience for the Indonesian developer community. Localizing the UX writing into Indonesian makes the platform more accessible and intuitive, while keeping the core identity phrase "AI-Powered Code Revitalization" ensures we maintain our premium international positioning for the core value prop.

## What Changes

We will replace English UX text across the entire application with Indonesian equivalents. This includes:

- **Landing Page**: Hero section, value propositions, features, and about sections.
- **Navbar & Footer**: Navigation links, call-to-action buttons, and social links.
- **User Interface**: Dashboard, document management, and profile settings.
- **Exception**: The phrase "AI-Powered Code Revitalization" will remain in English as per branding requirements.

## Capabilities

- `landing-localization`: Update all text elements on the landing page (Hero, Features, About, Banner).
- `navbar-footer-localization`: Localize navigation links and footer content.
- `ui-dashboard-localization`: Translate the user profile, document grid, and management interfaces.

## Impact

- **Improved User Engagement**: Indonesian users will feel more at home and find the tool easier to navigate.
- **Brand Consistency**: Maintains the premium "AI" focus while being culturally relevant.
- **Clearer Communication**: Technical terms and instructions will be translated into natural Indonesian developer-speak.
