# Proposal: PostgreSQL Database Schema for Legacyver

## Problem

Currently, the application lacks a persistent database to store user sessions, managed repositories, and their corresponding generated documentation. All documentation data is currently mocked, which prevents real-world usage and persistence of results across sessions.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a PostgreSQL schema that accurately represents the application's data model. This includes tables for user management, repository tracking, and a robust storage for the multi-page analysis results generated by the AI (Legacyver Analysis).

## Capabilities

- **User Management**: Track user sessions and login status.
- **Repository Tracking**: Store information about repositories targeted for legacy analysis.
- **Documentation Storage**: Store structured, multi-page generated documentation linked to specific repositories.
- **Schema Extensibility**: Ensure the schema can handle future additions like activity logs or user preferences.

## Impact

- Enables real persistence for the application.
- Allows users to return to previously generated analyses.
- Provides a foundation for implementing real authentication and repository synchronization.
- Replaces mock data in `src/lib/mock-data.ts` with real database queries in future steps.
